    <h1>Scentoire Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 2026<br>
      <strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Scentoire mobile application and related services
      (collectively, the “Service”), operated by Scentoire (“Scentoire,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By downloading, accessing,
      or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility and Account Use</h2>
    <p>
      You must be at least 13 years old to use Scentoire. By using the Service, you represent that you meet this requirement
      and that the information you provide during account creation is accurate and complete. You are responsible for
      maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Nature of the Service</h2>
    <p>
      Scentoire is a reflective journaling and emotional-wellness application that uses artificial intelligence to support
      personal reflection and emotional awareness. The Service is intended for general wellness and self-reflection purposes only.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      <strong>Not medical advice:</strong> Scentoire is not a medical device, does not provide therapy or medical services,
      does not diagnose conditions, and does not replace professional care. If you believe you are in immediate danger,
      contact local emergency services or a qualified professional.
    </p>

    <h2>3. User Content and Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      You retain ownership of the content you submit to Scentoire, including journal entries and messages (“User Content”).
      By using the Service, you grant Scentoire a limited, non-exclusive right to process, store, and analyze your User Content
      solely for the purpose of operating the Service in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are solely responsible for your User Content and agree not to submit content that is unlawful, abusive, threatening,
      or intended to harm others or the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>4. AI-Generated Content Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      The Service uses automated AI systems to generate responses. These responses may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading,
      or insensitive. Scentoire does not guarantee the accuracy or suitability of AI-generated output, and you agree that your
      use of such output is at your own discretion and risk.
    </p>
    <p>AI-generated content does not constitute medical, psychological, legal, or professional advice.</p>

    <h2>5. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <p>
      Certain features may require a paid subscription. All payments are processed exclusively through Apple’s App Store
      in-app purchase system. Subscription pricing, billing cycles, renewals, and cancellations are governed by Apple’s terms
      and policies. Scentoire does not process payments directly and does not have access to your payment method details.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Free Usage and Feature Access</h2>
    <p>
      Scentoire may offer limited free usage or trial access. We reserve the right to modify, limit, or discontinue free usage
      thresholds or features at any time, provided that paid subscription entitlements are honored according to Apple’s policies.
      Safety-related and crisis-support features are never gated behind a subscription.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>
      You agree not to misuse the Service, including attempting to interfere with system integrity, reverse-engineering the application,
      accessing the Service through unauthorized means, or using the Service in a way that violates applicable laws or regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access if we reasonably believe your use violates these Terms or poses a risk
      to the Service or other users.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Your use of the Service is subject to our Privacy Policy, which explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.
      By using Scentoire, you consent to the data practices described in the Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Account Termination and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      You may stop using the Service at any time and request deletion of your account by contacting
      <a href="mailto:support@scentoire.app">support@scentoire.app</a>. Upon deletion, your data will be handled in accordance
      with our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scentoire may suspend or terminate your access if required by law or if you materially breach these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Service Availability and Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service at any time. The Service is provided on an “as is” and
      “as available” basis, and uninterrupted operation is not guaranteed.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      All intellectual property rights in the Service, including software, design, and branding, are owned by or licensed to Scentoire.
      These Terms do not grant you any rights except as necessary to use the Service as intended.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, Scentoire disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including warranties of
      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Your use of the Service is at your own risk.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, Scentoire shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
      or punitive damages arising from or related to your use of the Service, including reliance on AI-generated content.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without regard to conflict-of-law
      principles, unless otherwise required by applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>15. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. When changes are made, the “Last Updated” date will be revised, and the updated
      Terms will be made available within the application. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
